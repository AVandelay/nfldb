Why is this:

  q = nfldb.Query(db)
  q.games(season_type='Regular', season_year=2012, week=1)
  q.players(position='P')
  ps = q.as_plays()

twice as slow as this:

  q = nfldb.Query(db)
  q.games(season_type='Regular', season_year=2012, week=1)
  q.players(team='NE')
  ps = q.as_plays()

when the latter returns more results?
