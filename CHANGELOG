0.0.13
======
  - Dummy release because I messed up. No substantial changes.

0.0.12
======
  - Don't depend on a specific version of pytz.
  - Change `nfldb-update` batch size so that it has a higher rate of
    success in lower memory environments.

0.0.11
======
  - Fixed city and team name for New York teams.
  - Set the cursor factory at cursor init instead of connection init.
    (This lets us use an older version of psycopg2.)
  - Added an `is_playing` property to games.
  - Expose `orelse` in the query interface, even though its semantics
    are confusing and unclear.
  - Added a `points` convenience method to compute the number of points
    scored in a single player statistic.
  - Provided a way to update only game schedules with the `nfldb-update`
    script. This is useful when game schedules change midway through
    the season. Currently, it must be run manually.
  - Don't update the DB with drives/plays if none are reported in the
    JSON. (In particular, this indicates corrupt JSON while the game
    is ongoing, so ignore it.)
  - `standard_team` cannot reasonably resolve "new york". It will now
    fail with a helpful assertion error.

0.0.10
======
  - Don't import errant drives (e.g., a drive without plays).

0.0.9
=====
  - Windows can't handle symlinks in setup.py.

0.0.8
=====
  - Invoke nflgame-update-players from nfldb-update in a cross platform
    way. e.g., `python -m nflgame.update_players` instead of
    `nflgame-update-players`.

0.0.7
=====
  - Fixed a bug where nfldb crashes if neither `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or
    `HOME` are set.
  - Changed `nfldb-dump` to omit owner information in the SQL dump.
  - Fixed embarrassing team misspellings.
  - Made pytz version dependency consistent with nflgame.

0.0.6
=====
  - Fix a bug in nfldb-update where the database wasn't being closed
    when being run with the `--interval` flag.
  - Added `player_search` which does fuzzy name matching.

0.0.5
=====
  - Fixed a broken link in the module/PyPI description.

0.0.4
=====
  - Numerous fixes for bugs I found while writing the nfldb wiki.

0.0.3
=====
  - Tons of documentation.
  - Added pytz as an explicit dependency.
  - Added a `show_where` method to the Query class for debugging search logic.

0.0.2
=====
  - Be a bit smarter with configuration files.

0.0.1
=====
Initial release.
